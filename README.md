# AttackOnTitanGame

This is a WIP Unity game based on Attack on Titan, allowing players to swing around and slay Titans.

See a video showcase: https://youtu.be/zNaYvUC8f_g

The titans use A* pathfinding, the dynamic animations make heavy use of Inverse Kinematics, allowing Titans to lean down and pick up players with their hands to swallow them.
